## Battleship-CLI Instructions

_Type `**help**` and hit return at any time during gameplay to show these instructions._

### Other helpful commands:
- Type `show board` at any time to see your own board including ship configuration, ships hit, and misses.
- Type `show score` at any time to check the status of the game.
- Type `quit` or `q` at any time to quit the game.

### Settings:
- __NOTE:__ If your terminal does not support Emojis, please disable Emojis in the settings menu.
- For a more challenging game, you can choose a larger board size.

### How to win:
- Each player has a battlefield represented by a 10x10 grid on which they place 5 ships, hidden to their opponent.
- The goal of the game is sink all of your opponents ships! A ship is sunk when it is hit once for each space it occupies.
- In other words, a submarine, which occupies 3 spaces, is sunk after being hit 3 times.
- The 5 ships occupy 17 total spaces, so the first player to register 17 hits wins!

### Gameplay:
- To play, follow the prompts to configure your five ships in any pattern you'd like (diagonal placements are not allowed).
- Valid configuration instructions include a ship name, a starting coordinate (A1-J10 for default 10x10 board), and a direction (right, left, up or down).
- For example: `submarine e3 up` or `carrier j7 left`. Ships cannot overlap, and you must stay within the bounds of the board.
- Once both players have configured their ships, the race is on to sink your opponent's ships before they sink yours!
- Fire torpedoes at your opponent's ships by guessing coordinates on the 10x10 board.
- Rows are represented by the letters A-J, and columns with the numbers 1-10 (10x10 board).
- Valid guesses include a row followed by a column, e.g. `A1`, `B7`, `J10`, etc.
- You will be informed if you've hit, missed, or sunk a ship.
- Sink all 5 of the computer's ships to win!

### Hint:
- When placing ships, you can also use abbreviations to make your life easier!
- Use the ship's abbreviations (see legend), and single letters for directions.
- e.g. `btl a9 r` or `cru i6 u`

### Legend:
- Battleship (BTL), 4 spaces
- Carrier (CAR), 5 spaces
- Cruiser (CRU), 3 spaces
- Destroyer (DST), 2 spaces
- Submarine (SUB), 3 spaces
- A hit looks like üí• or ` X ` (depending on Emoji support)
- A miss looks like ‚ùå or ` 0 ` (depending on Emoji support)
